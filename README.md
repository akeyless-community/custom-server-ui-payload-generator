# Akeyless Custom UI Rotation Payload Generator

## Overview

The Akeyless Custom UI Rotation Payload Generator is a web-based tool designed to simplify the process of creating custom UI rotation payloads for use with the Akeyless Secrets Management platform. This tool allows users to easily map recorded UI interactions to the appropriate fields required by Akeyless for custom UI-based credential rotation.

## Purpose

In the realm of secrets management and credential rotation, there are scenarios where standard rotation methods may not suffice. For instance, when dealing with legacy systems or applications with unique authentication flows, a custom UI-based approach to credential rotation becomes necessary. This tool bridges the gap between recorded UI interactions and the Akeyless platform's requirements for custom rotation.

## Key Features

- Drag-and-drop interface for mapping recorded UI selectors to Akeyless fields
- JSON file upload for easy import of recorded interactions
- Password generation options customization
- Real-time payload generation
- Integration with Akeyless Gateway for seamless workflow

## How It Works

1. **Record UI Interaction**: Use a browser's developer tools (e.g., Chrome DevTools Recorder) to record the UI interaction for credential rotation.
2. **Generate JSON**: Export the recorded interaction as a JSON file.
3. **Upload to Tool**: [Use this web application](https://akeyless-community.github.io/custom-server-ui-payload-generator/) to upload the JSON file.
4. **Map Fields**: Drag and drop the recorded selectors to map them to the appropriate Akeyless fields (username, current password, new password).
5. **Configure Options**: Adjust password generation options if needed.
6. **Generate Payload**: Create the payload required by Akeyless for custom rotation.
7. **Use with Akeyless**: Apply the generated payload in the Akeyless platform for custom UI-based rotation.

## Integration with Akeyless Gateway

This tool generates a payload that can be used directly with the Akeyless Gateway for custom UI-based rotation. The integration process involves:

1. Setting up a Web Target in Akeyless pointing to your custom rotation endpoint.
2. Creating a custom Rotated Secret in Akeyless, using the payload generated by this tool.
3. Configuring the Akeyless Gateway to use this custom Rotated Secret for the specific credential that requires UI-based rotation.

The Akeyless Gateway will then use the provided payload to perform the custom rotation, interacting with the target system's UI as defined in the recorded steps.

## Usage

1. Upload your JSON file containing the recorded UI interactions.
2. Drag and drop the selectors from the "Unmapped Fields" to the appropriate mapping boxes (Username, Password, New Password).
3. Adjust the password options if necessary.
4. Click "Generate Payload" to create the Akeyless-compatible payload.
5. Copy the generated payload and use it in your Akeyless custom Rotated Secret configuration.
